# Authority Model (v0)

## Tier A — Requires human approval (Change Proposal)
- Product Vision (VISION.md)
- Product Standards (PRODUCT_STANDARDS.md)
- Technical Constraints (TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md)
- Operating Model (oais/core/operating_model.md)
- Authority Model (this doc)
- Security constraints / non-negotiables

## Tier B — Agent editable with audit
- Agent definitions
- Workflow specs
- Feature specs
- Index docs

## Tier C — Autonomous
- Implementation code changes
- Tests, refactors, performance improvements
- Minor doc clarifications (non-structural)

## Rule
Any Tier A change must be proposed via oais/workflows/change_management.md and approved by the human.
