# System Constraints (v0)

## Non-negotiable rules
1. Tier A docs cannot be edited without a Change Proposal + human approval.
2. All new **OAIS docs** (under `/oais`) must be added to `oais/index/canonical_index.md`.
3. Any agent making changes must record what changed and why in the relevant feature log.
4. No direct-to-production changes without a Convergence Review gate.

## Safety rails
- If uncertain about requirements, agents must escalate to the human.
- Agents must not “invent” system rules not present in Tier A docs.
- Prefer minimal changes over broad refactors unless explicitly requested.
