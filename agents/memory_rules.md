# Memory Rules (v0)

## Canonical truth
- oais/index/canonical_index.md is the entry point for OAIS knowledge (docs under `/oais`).
- Tier A docs define system direction and authority.

## Update policy
- Agents may update Tier B docs as needed, but must:
  - update the canonical index if new OAIS docs are created
  - write a short changelog note in the edited doc or the feature log

## Conflict policy
- If two docs conflict, Tier A wins.
- If ambiguity remains, escalate to the human.
